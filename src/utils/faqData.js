    question: "How does Paymora work?",
    answer:
      "Getting started is simple. Once your school signs up, you’ll be able to upload your student list, set up your academic fee structures, and generate unique payment links for each student or class. Parents can then pay securely via our platform using cards, bank transfers, or USSD. Every payment is tracked in real time, and receipts are automatically generated — saving you hours of admin work."

    question: "Do I need an account?",
    answer:
      "Yes, each school or organization using Paymora gets a secure admin dashboard. From there, you can manage student profiles, assign and customize fees, view transaction histories, download financial reports, and communicate with parents. The dashboard is designed to be intuitive even if you’re not tech-savvy, and our support team is always here to help you get the most out of it."

    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      "Paymora operates on a simple, transparent model: we charge ₦200 per successful transaction. That’s it. No setup fees, no monthly subscriptions, and no hidden charges. You only pay when a parent makes a payment — meaning we only earn when you do."
